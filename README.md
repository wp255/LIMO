# LIMO
Experimental implementation and datasets for the paper "LIMO: Large Language Model-Empowered Intent-Driven Network Management and Orchestration"


To support on-demand network services towards 6G networks, we present a large language model-empowered intent-driven network management and orchestration framework named LIMO. Although large language models have already been applied to intent-driven network management, there still lacks an intent full lifecycle design encompassing intent translation, policy generation, code generation, and continuous assurance. To bridge this gap, we present the LIMO framework with intent-enabled, policy generation, and code implementation layers, each integrating distinct large language model functionalities. Meanwhile, we deploy a proof-of-concept implementation of the presented LIMO framework in 6G radio access networks. In terms of the intent translation, fine-tuned large language models achieve 48%--50% higher accuracy compared to their foundation models without domain-specific adaptation. For the policy optimization, the presented framework outperforms five baseline schemes, achieving a maximum service-level agreement satisfaction rate of 96.0%. Finally, the presented LIMO successfully generates executable code for managing and orchestrating the underlying infrastructure. Overall, experimental results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the presented LIMO framework.
